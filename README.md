# Simple MFF slides starter

A "starter" non-template for presentation/defense slides.

How-to:

- Build with `make`; a [pre-built version is available](build/slides.pdf).
- Read extra commentary in `slides.tex`.
- Make sure you __erase all text__ from the starter after reading it and start
  anew; the existing text is almost surely wrong for your use case.
